Cassandra Snapshot Publisher - csp
====================================================

A script to build SNAPSHOT artifacts from Cassandra 
and deploy them to Maven repositories.

It can often be useful to work with the latest and
greatest version of Cassandra (from trunk or a 
release branch). However, the Apache release processes
mandate certain practices around deployment which can
make it difficult to build and deploy SNAPSHOT artifacts
to your local Maven repository without hacking the 
Cassandra build files. 

csp works by transforming Cassandra's build.xml to 
remove the problematic elements, replacing them with simple
alternatives (e.g. it replaces the sign-and-deploy-file 
from the mvn-gpg-plugin with the regular deploy:deploy-file 
in the deployment macro). It also skips some of the more
time consuming steps such as javadoc generation.

Requirements
------------

- A working python installation (tested to work with python 2.7).

Installation
------------

csp uses python distutils so from the source directory:
sudo ./setup.py install

Usage
-----

The following options may be passed on the command line:

-c, --cassandra-dir : Path to the Cassandra source directory.
                      Defaults to the current working directory
-r, --revision      : Git revision that you want to build a snapshot
                      from. Defaults to the current checked out HEAD
-v, --version       : The version # that you want to give the snapshot.
                      Defaults to whatever is specified in build.xml
-u, --repo-url    	: The URL of the Maven repo where you intend to 
                      publish the snapshot artifacts
-i, --repo-id     	: The identifier of the target repo from your 
                      Maven settings.xml 

Of these options, the Cassandra source directory and the Maven repo
URL/id can be set using an ini file located at ~/.csp 
Any options set on the command line will override those in the config
file.
